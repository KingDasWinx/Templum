# Templum

An infinite canvas of terminals. Spawn as many terminals as you like, place them anywhere,
resize them like blocks, and pan and zoom around your workspace.

> **Status: pre-alpha.** The foundation is being laid; there is nothing usable yet.

## Why

- **Native and light.** Pure Rust, drawn directly on the GPU. No webview, no Electron.
- **Cross-platform.** macOS, Linux (Wayland and X11) and Windows.
- **Built on proven parts.** Terminal emulation by [`alacritty_terminal`](https://crates.io/crates/alacritty_terminal),
  UI by [GPUI](https://www.gpui.rs) (Zed's GPU framework) through [gpui-kit](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-kit).
  See [the architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and the [decision records](docs/adr/).

## Build from source

You need [rustup](https://rustup.rs); the pinned toolchain installs itself.
Platform prerequisites are listed in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KingDasWinx/Templum
cd Templum
cargo run -p templum
```

## Pre-built binaries

There are no releases yet. When they arrive on the [releases page](https://github.com/KingDasWinx/Templum/releases),
they will be **unsigned** at first:

- **macOS:** right-click the app → *Open* → *Open* (only needed the first time).
- **Windows:** on the SmartScreen prompt, click *More info* → *Run anyway*.
